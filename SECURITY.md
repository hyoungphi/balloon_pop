# Security Considerations

## Resolved Vulnerabilities

This project has been updated to address the majority of security vulnerabilities reported by npm audit:

- **Fixed**: 31 out of 33 original vulnerabilities (94% resolved)
- **Eliminated**: All critical and high severity vulnerabilities
- **Remaining**: 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

### webpack-dev-server (2 moderate severity issues)

**CVE**: GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h, GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v  
**Severity**: Moderate  
**Impact**: Users' source code may be stolen when accessing a malicious website

**Why Not Fixed**: 
- These vulnerabilities only affect the development server, not production builds
- Fixing them would require `npm audit fix --force` which would downgrade react-scripts to version 0.0.0, breaking the entire application
- The vulnerabilities require specific attack scenarios (user visiting malicious website while dev server is running)
- This appears to be a personal/educational project where the risk is minimal

**Mitigation**:
- Only run the development server in trusted environments
- Don't expose the dev server to public networks
- Use production builds for deployment (which are not affected)

## Package Overrides Applied

The following package overrides were applied to resolve most vulnerabilities while maintaining compatibility:

```json
"overrides": {
  "nth-check": ">=2.0.1",
  "postcss": ">=8.4.31"
}
```

These overrides force npm to use secure versions of these packages even when they're nested deep in the dependency tree.

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Continue using the current setup as the remaining risks are minimal
2. **For Production**: Always use `npm run build` and deploy the built assets
3. **Future Updates**: Monitor for react-scripts updates that may resolve the webpack-dev-server issues
4. **Alternative**: Consider migrating to Vite or other modern build tools if more recent security updates are critical
