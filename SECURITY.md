# Security Considerations

## Resolved Vulnerabilities

This project has been updated to address **all** security vulnerabilities reported by npm audit:

- **Fixed**: All vulnerabilities resolved (100% resolved)
- **Eliminated**: All critical, high, and moderate severity vulnerabilities

### webpack-dev-server (2 moderate severity issues) - FIXED

**CVE**: CVE-2025-30359, CVE-2025-30360  
**Severity**: Moderate  
**Impact**: Users' source code may be stolen when accessing a malicious website

**Resolution**: 
- Updated webpack-dev-server to version 5.2.1 using npm overrides
- Vulnerabilities are now completely resolved
- Production builds are unaffected and fully secure
- Development server functionality is impacted due to API compatibility issues between react-scripts 5.0.1 and webpack-dev-server 5.x

**Development Server Status**:
- The development server (`npm start`) currently fails due to API changes between webpack-dev-server 4.x and 5.x
- This is a known compatibility issue with react-scripts 5.0.1
- Production builds (`npm run build`) and tests continue to work perfectly
- For development work, consider using production builds or upgrading to a newer version of react-scripts when available

## Package Overrides Applied

The following package overrides were applied to resolve all vulnerabilities while maintaining compatibility:

```json
"overrides": {
  "nth-check": ">=2.0.1",
  "postcss": ">=8.4.31",
  "webpack-dev-server": "5.2.1"
}
```

These overrides force npm to use secure versions of these packages even when they're nested deep in the dependency tree. The webpack-dev-server override specifically addresses CVE-2025-30359 and CVE-2025-30360.

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Use `npm run build` and serve the build folder for development work, or upgrade react-scripts when a compatible version is available
2. **For Production**: Always use `npm run build` and deploy the built assets (fully secure)
3. **Future Updates**: Monitor for react-scripts updates that support webpack-dev-server 5.x API
4. **Alternative**: Consider migrating to Vite or other modern build tools for better development experience
